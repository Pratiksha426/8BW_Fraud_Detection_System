# 8BW_Fraud_Detection_System
Overview
This fraud detection system is designed to identify suspicious activities and transactions within a given dataset. It utilizes machine learning algorithms to analyze various features and detect patterns indicative of fraudulent behavior.

Features
Data preprocessing: Cleansing and transforming raw data for analysis.
Feature engineering: Creating relevant features from the dataset to enhance model performance.
Model training: Training machine learning models on labeled data to predict fraudulent activities.
Model evaluation: Assessing the performance of trained models using appropriate metrics.
Prediction: Applying the trained model to new data to classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate.
